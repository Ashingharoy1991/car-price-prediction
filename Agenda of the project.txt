In this project, I aimed to create models (linear regression and Gradient Boosting) to predict the prices of used cars using different features. I gathered data from a quick online source and processed it to prepare it for analysis. While my models achieved an accuracy of 83%, I noticed that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were relatively high. To enhance the model's performance, one could explore using more sophisticated models, such as complex algorithms, or fine-tune the model further by adjusting its hyperparameters. Additionally, having a larger dataset might contribute to improving the overall predictive capabilities of the models..
